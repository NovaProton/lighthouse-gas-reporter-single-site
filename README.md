# üìä Lighthouse Reporter (Single Site) ‚Äì Google Apps Script

This Google Apps Script runs automated [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) audits for a single website and writes the results to a connected Google Sheet. It supports both **Mobile** and **Desktop** audit strategies and logs performance data across a wide range of metrics.

---

## üìÅ What It Does

* Fetches Lighthouse scores using the official PageSpeed Insights API.
* Appends audit results to:

  * A strategy-specific sheet (e.g., `Mobile` or `Desktop`)
  * A shared **Combined** sheet with a device label
* Implements retry logic for quota limits and server errors.

## üß† Notes

* Metrics like FCP, LCP, CLS, and TBT are **core web vitals**.
* The script uses exponential backoff for quota or server errors (429 or 5xx).
* Intended for use with Google Sheets and scheduled via time-driven triggers.
